# Student project template

This is a template for student projects.

We use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) to administrate our student projects. So, please be sure to sign up for a [GitHub Account](http://github.com). Please use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template/blob/master/student_project.ipynb) to work on your project. You can look at this example on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template/master?filepath=student_project.ipynb). To ensure full reproducibility of your project, be sure to maintain [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as your continuous integration service.

## Frequently asked questions and answers

* *Where can I look for publications that provide the data behind their research?* Some journals provide the data for their published articles as data supplements directly on their website. In addition, the [Replication Wiki](http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)  and the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu) compile a lot such information.

* *What are other useful resources for research data?* There is a tremendous amount of data available online. For example, MDRC provides a host of data files for public use [here](https://www.mdrc.org/available-public-use-files) from the evaluation of public policy initiatives.
