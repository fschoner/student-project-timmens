# Student Project - Tim Mensinger and Florian Schoner

## Aim

In this project we try to understand the method (causal trees) presented in Athey (2015), which estimates heterogenous treatment effects. The project will be split into various parts:

1. Implement a classical regression tree algorithm (since their method is based on regression trees) [Done] 
2. Using the implemented algorithm from above and guidelines from the paper we try to implement the causal tree [In the making...]
3. Produce small simulation study which will compare the following methods in a heterogenous treatment setting [to be done]
* Classical treatment effect estimator which does **not** account for heterogeneity 
* Classical treatment effect estimator which does account for heterogeneity
* Causal Trees
4. [Outlook on how to get from Causal Trees to Causal Forests] 
5. [Proofs of Theorems and Lemmata] 


P.S. Thank you Dr. Eisenhauer for creating the MIT License file; I too approve of sharing my code with everyone else under the MIT license. For everyone who wants to use my code just send me an email to tim.mensinger(at)uni-bonn.de; I love to talk about machine learning in economics and learn more about that topic, so if you have **ANY** questions or remarks, feel free to ask.
