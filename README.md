# Student Project - Tim Mensinger 

## Here will be some interesting text in the near future 

P.S. Thank you Dr. Eisenhauer for creating the MIT License file; I too approve of sharing my code with everyone else under the MIT license. For everyone who wants to use my code just send me an email to tim.mensinger(at)uni-bonn.de; I love to talk about machine learning in economics and learn more about that topic, so if you have **ANY** questions, feel free to send them to me.
