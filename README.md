# Student Project - Tim Mensinger and Florian Schoner

## Aim

In this project we try to understand the method (causal trees) presented in Athey (2015), which estimates heterogenous treatment effects. The project will be split into various parts:

### [Causal Tree](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-timmens/master/causal_tree/methodology.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-timmens/master?filepath=causal_tree%methodology.ipynb)


Here we first implement a classical regression tree algorithm, since their method is based on such algorithms, and then adjust the necessary parts following the guidelines of the given paper. See folder causal_tree for details.

### [Simulation Study](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-timmens/master/Simulation_Study/First_writeup.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-timmens/master?filepath=Simulation_Study%First_writeup.ipynb)

In this section we will compare popular methods used to estimate treatment effects in a heterogenous treatment setting. See folder Simulation_Study for for a more detailed discussion.
