# Student Project - Tim Mensinger and Florian Schoner

## Aim

In this project we try to understand the method (causal trees) presented in Athey (2015), which estimates heterogenous treatment effects. The project will be split into various parts:

### Causal Tree

Here we first implement a classical regression tree algorithm, since their method is based on such algorithms, and then adjust the necessary parts following the guidelines of the given paper. See folder causal_tree for details.

### Simulation Study 

In this section we will compare popular methods used to estimate treatment effects in a heterogenous treatment setting. See folder Simulation_Study for for a more detailed discussion.

P.S. Thank you Dr. Eisenhauer for creating the MIT License file; I too approve of sharing my code with everyone else under the MIT license. For everyone who wants to use my code just send me an email to tim.mensinger(at)uni-bonn.de; I love to talk about machine learning in economics and learn more about that topic, so if you have **ANY** questions or remarks, feel free to ask.
